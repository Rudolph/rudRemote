# rudRemote
Building robots is fun. Building autonomous robots is even more fun. But sometimes, especially when fleshing out chassis or drivetrain designs, you just want to drive the darn thing. Or maybe you've built a simple telepresence bot that needs to be controlled everywhere it goes. Perhaps you've built an arm that doesn't need to go anywhere, but has several channels in need of input. Wouldn't it be swell to have one radio transmitter that could talk to any of your creations simply by adding a $3 (or less) NRF24 radio transceiver? 

That's what rudRemote is for. Using almost anything with potentiometers, rudRemote can finally be that "one remote to rule them all" that you didn't even know you wanted.

And what could make it even better? In the name of freedom, and democracy, and stuff... All the code will be freely available under the MIT License!
